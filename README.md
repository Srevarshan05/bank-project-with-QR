Project Description: Python Banking System
___________________________________________________
Overview:
---------
The Python Banking System is a comprehensive project designed to simulate real-time banking functionalities using Python. This system provides users with essential banking operations such as depositing, withdrawal, balance checking, and secure transaction verification through OTP (One-Time Password). Additionally, upon the completion of each transaction, a QR code is generated to encapsulate the transaction details, allowing for easy retrieval and verification by simply scanning the code.
